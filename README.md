# learn-jupyter

Jupyter is a powerful note book program for data related work. It can used for print markdown, python, javascript, HTML code and even run the bash command.

Here is one of the examples.

It could be express by the follow string on markdown cell block.

```
$$
\int_{a}^{b} f(x)\, dx \approx \frac{1}{2} \sum_{k=1}^{N} \left( x_{k} - x_{k-1} \right) \left( f(x_{k}) + f(x_{k-1}) \right).
$$
```

for more samples, please checkout my "first tiral.ipynb" file.
